# List of tasks to prepare the base instance
#   - Set DNS
#   - Set PackageManager(apt) proxy
#   - Scan for new disks
#   - Install OpenVM-Tools

# Future improvement might include:
#   - Security management (Fail2Ban, restrictions)
#   - Monitoring
# but those might better be done via import from the main play
